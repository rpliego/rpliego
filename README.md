# 👋 Hi, I'm Roberto Pliego

## Core Software Engineer | Data Science Specialist

My profile is defined by a deep, dual expertise: a foundational background in **High-Performance Software Engineering** from the **42 Barcelona Common Core** program, combined with a practical specialization in **Data Science and Machine Learning** from Ironhack.

I am driven by the challenge of bridging these two worlds: building **efficient, tested systems** using C/C++ and Algorithms, and leveraging Python and specialized tools to derive **actionable business value** from complex datasets. My background includes demonstrated **resilience and client management** skills gained through demanding professional experience.

I am currently exploring opportunities and connecting with professionals at the intersection of **Advanced Analytics, System Optimization, and MLOps.**
